generally, if you want to render pagination,
it looks like some regularity between page address

like this : IP2, IP3
so basic idea is combine seperated part with variable x
pre = 'https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/berlin-junior-data-analyst-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,6_IC2622109_KO7,26_IP'
url = pre+str(x)+tail
but after comparison between tail parts of pages,
I get to realized that pagination is quite difficult to implemen in this webpage
(address encryption)

# tail of page3
 .htm?includeNoSalaryJobs=true&pgc=AB4AAoEAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbRcco4AKgEBAQ8AlE1esmV0jt%2FpCqGBFZoL9moV1PR7XNrKpC6nXSnUERn2vpv9XQAA

#tail of page4
